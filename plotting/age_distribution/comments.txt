Day graph:
we don't really have enough data to get the exponential decay we are expecting - too noisy
Get inidividual peaks on certain days - they are likely individual files that are accessed a lot (as this analysis was only on one days worth of accesses, so any files the same age are made at the same time
Need to think about excluding these popular files from future analysis - TODO find out file names

Month graph:
with more data can now see the expected drop off with age
curious about bump at ~150 days and bump at ~400 days
the small bumps further out have rectangular peaks are now around 30 days wide - probably the same files seen earlier
